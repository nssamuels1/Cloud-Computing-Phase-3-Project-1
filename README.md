## Scope of Work

Using Google Cloud Utilities; App Engine, Google Maps API and Bootstrap (HTML). I will build a website of Black/African American Historical Landmarks which will each be identified by markers on Google Maps. Node.js to aid in running the website on App Engine.
## Methodology

The website is for travel, historical and educational purposes. Ultimately, users can access this website to see the location of Black/African American Historical Landmarks in the United States. 
Google App Engine is used to deploy the web site on the Cloud with Node.js as the web service. Google Maps API was used for all mapping features. BootStrap template was used for the layout of the website.
Future consideration would be to use Google Cloud Storage to store all relevant location information and any other features and add-ons as the site grows in user base
